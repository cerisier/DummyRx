# DummyRx

This repository contains dummy implementations of Rx in Kotlin and Swift mostly as an educational and training purposes for developers that are new to Rx.

The goal is to expose a very minimal API surface and basic operators to give the reader a sense of how Rx works at its most basic level.

## Considerations

Many concepts are omitted on purpose. They may appear later if needed.
